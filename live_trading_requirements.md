# Live Trading System Requirements

## üö´ Current System Status: NOT READY FOR LIVE TRADING

Your current system is a **LEARNING SIMULATION** only. Here's what you need for actual trading:

## ‚úÖ Required Components for Live Trading

### 1. Real Market Data Integration
- [ ] Live price feeds (OANDA, MT4/5, or broker API)
- [ ] Real-time technical indicators
- [ ] Actual market hours and session data
- [ ] Economic calendar integration
- [ ] News feed integration

### 2. Broker Integration
- [ ] OANDA API setup and authentication
- [ ] Real account connection
- [ ] Order placement and management
- [ ] Position tracking and monitoring
- [ ] Account balance and margin calculations

### 3. Risk Management System
- [ ] Real position sizing based on account balance
- [ ] Stop-loss and take-profit execution
- [ ] Maximum drawdown protection
- [ ] Correlation limits across real positions
- [ ] Emergency stop functionality

### 4. Historical Data Training
- [ ] Train AI on actual historical OHLC data
- [ ] Use real spreads and execution costs
- [ ] Include actual market volatility patterns
- [ ] Test on out-of-sample data

### 5. Paper Trading Phase
- [ ] Test with simulated money on real market data
- [ ] Validate performance over 3-6 months
- [ ] Ensure consistent profitability
- [ ] Monitor for curve fitting

### 6. Regulatory Compliance
- [ ] Understand local trading regulations
- [ ] Risk disclosures and warnings
- [ ] Account verification requirements
- [ ] Tax implications

## ‚ö†Ô∏è REALISTIC TIMELINE

### Phase 1: Real Data Integration (2-4 weeks)
- Replace random simulation with OANDA historical data
- Retrain AI on actual market patterns
- Implement real spread and cost calculations

### Phase 2: Paper Trading (3-6 months)
- Test on live market data with simulated money
- Track real-time performance
- Identify and fix issues

### Phase 3: Live Trading Preparation (1-2 months)
- Set up live broker accounts
- Implement full risk management
- Start with very small position sizes

### Phase 4: Live Trading (Ongoing)
- Begin with $200-500 maximum
- Monitor performance closely
- Scale up only after consistent profitability

## üí∞ Expected Live Performance

**Reality Check:**
- Your simulated 51% win rate ‚Üí Likely 35-40% live
- Simulated profits ‚Üí Likely break-even or small losses initially
- Need 6+ months of consistent profitability before scaling

## üéØ Recommended Next Steps

1. **Integrate Real Historical Data** (Priority #1)
   - Use OANDA API to get historical OHLC data
   - Replace random market simulation
   - Retrain AI on actual patterns

2. **Build Paper Trading System**
   - Connect to live data feeds
   - Simulate real trades without money
   - Track actual performance

3. **Extensive Testing**
   - Test for 3-6 months minimum
   - Verify consistent profitability
   - Understand real market behavior

## ‚ùå What NOT to Do

- ‚ùå Use simulation results to predict live performance
- ‚ùå Start live trading without real data training
- ‚ùå Risk more than you can afford to lose completely
- ‚ùå Expect immediate profitability
- ‚ùå Scale up quickly after early wins

## ‚úÖ Safe Approach

1. Train on real historical data first
2. Paper trade for months
3. Start live with tiny amounts ($50-100)
4. Prove consistency before adding more capital
5. Never risk more than 1-2% per trade
