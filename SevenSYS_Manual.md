## ??? Technical Architecture

### Core Components

#### 1. **Multi-Timeframe EMA System**
`
EMA 8   - Short-term momentum (Orange, LineWidth: 4)
EMA 21  - Medium-term trend (Blue, LineWidth: 4)
EMA 50  - Intermediate trend
EMA 200 - Long-term trend (Red, LineWidth: 4)
HTF EMA21 - 4H timeframe confirmation
`

**Purpose**: Establishes trend hierarchy and alignment
**Signal**: All EMAs aligned = Strong directional bias

#### 2. **Momentum Oscillators**
`
RSI (14)     - Relative Strength Index
MACD (12,26,9) - Moving Average Convergence Divergence
Stochastic (14) - Price momentum within range
`

**Purpose**: Confirms entry timing and momentum strength
**Filters**: RSI 40-80 (bull), 20-60 (bear), Stoch 20-80 (neutral zone)

#### 3. **Volume & Price Action**
`
Volume MA (20) - Average volume baseline
VWAP - Volume Weighted Average Price
ATR (14) - Average True Range for volatility
`

**Purpose**: Validates moves with institutional participation
**Confirmation**: Volume > MA + Price above/below VWAP

#### 4. **Session Analysis**
`
Asian:    00:00-08:00 Tokyo (Score: 5.0)
London:   08:00-16:00 GMT (Score: 7.0)
New York: 13:00-22:00 EST (Score: 8.0)
Overlap:  London+NY (Score: 10.0)
`

**Purpose**: Trades during optimal liquidity periods
**Premium**: London/NY overlap for maximum institutional activity

## ?? Signal Generation

### Signal Strength Calculation

#### Long Signal Formula:
`
Base Strength = 50.0
+ Trend Strength (>0) × 2.0
+ Momentum Score (>0) × 1.5
+ Session Score
+ Price Action Score (>0) × 1.5
= Total Long Signal Strength
`

#### Short Signal Formula:
`
Base Strength = 50.0
+ |Trend Strength| (<0) × 2.0
+ |Momentum Score| (<0) × 1.5
+ Session Score
+ |Price Action Score| (<0) × 1.5
= Total Short Signal Strength
`

### Entry Conditions

#### Primary Long Entry:
- Trend Strength > 3.0
- Momentum Score > 3.0
- Active trading session
- Normal volatility (ATR 0.01-2.5%)
- Price above VWAP
- Signal Strength = 55%

#### Backup Long Entry:
- EMA8 > EMA21
- Close > VWAP
- RSI > 45
- Active session
- Signal Strength = 50%

#### Primary Short Entry:
- Trend Strength < -3.0
- Momentum Score < -3.0
- Active trading session
- Normal volatility
- Price below VWAP
- Signal Strength = 55%

#### Backup Short Entry:
- EMA8 < EMA21
- Close < VWAP
- RSI < 55
- Active session
- Signal Strength = 50%

### Visual Signals
- **Green Triangle Up**: Long entry signal
- **Red Triangle Down**: Short entry signal
- **Yellow X-Cross**: Safety stop triggered
- **Red Crisis Line**: Emergency conditions (when visible)

---

## ??? Risk Management

### Position Sizing
- **Default**: 2% of equity per trade
- **Range**: 0.5% - 5% (adjustable)
- **Calculation**: Risk amount ÷ stop distance = position size

### Dynamic Stop Loss
`
ATR Multiplier Logic:
- High Volatility (ATR > 0.8%): 1.2x multiplier
- Medium Volatility (ATR > 0.4%): 1.5x multiplier  
- Normal Volatility: 2.0x multiplier

Stop Distance = ATR × Multiplier
Long Stop = Entry Price - Stop Distance
Short Stop = Entry Price + Stop Distance
`

### Take Profit Targets
`
TP Multiplier Logic:
- Strong Trend (|Trend| > 8): 3.5x stop distance
- Medium Trend (|Trend| > 5): 2.8x stop distance
- Weak Trend: 2.0x stop distance

Profit Distance = Stop Distance × TP Multiplier
Long TP = Entry Price + Profit Distance
Short TP = Entry Price - Profit Distance
`

### Safety Nets

#### 1. **Market Crisis Detection**
- **Trigger**: ATR > 2.0%
- **Action**: Close all positions immediately
- **Visual**: Red crisis line appears

#### 2. **Account Drawdown Protection**
- **Trigger**: Equity < 90% of initial capital
- **Action**: Close all positions immediately
- **Purpose**: Prevent catastrophic account damage

#### 3. **Daily Loss Limit**
- **Default**: 5% daily loss limit
- **Monitoring**: Tracks daily P&L vs starting equity
- **Action**: Prevents further trading when limit reached

#### 4. **Maximum Drawdown Stop**
- **Default**: 10% maximum drawdown
- **Calculation**: Peak equity to current equity
- **Action**: System shutdown on breach
